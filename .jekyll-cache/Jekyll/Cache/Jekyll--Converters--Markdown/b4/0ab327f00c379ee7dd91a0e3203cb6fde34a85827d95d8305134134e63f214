I"¾<p>at the hotel room<br />peeling off my bathing suit<br />i catch a glimpse<br />of myself in the mirror<br />and run a finger<br />over the skin<br />untouched by the sun.</p>

<p>in the shower<br />i scrub vigorously<br />at the places<br />the sun had tainted<br />until they all glow red.</p>

<p>i was young,<br />too young to be pretty,<br />but just old enough to know what it was</p>

<p>and just old enough to know that i wasnâ€™t.</p>

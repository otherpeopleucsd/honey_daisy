<p>My mother stands there at the sink, washing the dishes<br />That we used just minutes before.<br />And her hands go washing, washing,<br />As she stares at her reflection in the window.</p>

<p>She’s running towards a jungle,<br />While the sun licks at her mocha skin.<br />And they cry ‘Morena! Morena!’<br />As she laughs and tries to catch at birds the color of the rainbow.</p>

<p>She’s moving away from a homeland,<br />A strange language on her lips.<br />And her dreams are larger than the moon and the earth,<br />More beautiful and grand than the stars.</p>

<p>She’s walking down a street,<br />In a place where futures are made.<br />And her future is higher than the sky,<br />In the shadow of a golden bear.</p>

<p>But</p>

<p>My mother stands at the sink, washing dishes,<br />That we used just minutes before.<br />And her hands go washing, washing,<br />As she stares at her reflection in the window</p>

<p>And sees all those dreams fly away, just like jungle birds<br />The color of the rainbow.</p>

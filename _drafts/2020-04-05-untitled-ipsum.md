There are no rules, except that gas is blood and green means go. You can be safe here, with me, in the stillness that I create. There are no rules, except that gas is my blood, and this is all mine. It’s all mine.

This is where I am not my mother’s daughter, where I am not my father’s daughter, where I am nobody except another cell in a pulsing, polluting population of traffic. I am me, and Stan is Stan, and we are all we need.

This is where no one can abandon me, because I’m in the driver seat. Try it, see if you can hurt me. See if you can puncture my four walls of shame, window-hung fleece blankets, doors locked, handles missing. We keep the world out of this place. We keep everything at a safe distance.

I make choices with my hands, I hold fate in my hands, I feel the risk and let my mind turn constantly, wheels in mud, gears in an engine, asking how stars can write destiny if I control this aluminum animal. This Earth-ridden spacecraft, to which no one has keys except me.

This is where gas is blood, where I cry coolant tears and lift my hood to release the steam building up in my system, growing toxic within my system. The peeling wheel holds air like an organ, a lung. It holds my breath, a mechanical extension of my dying body, oxygen molecules that panic and push for freedom. The organ begs with a corporeal longing for pain. My hand curls, and I feel each punch in my gut, losing air, hissing and bellowing like a wounded creature.

You will ask about the vetements in my backseat, the trash bags, the candy bar wrappers and powder piles of rouge. You will pull the Tupperware of half-melted ice from beneath a seat and ask me the same questions - why, why am I like this, how broken must I be. You will wonder who lives like this, who lets the crumbs pile up in mountains between seat cracks and sees the check engine light as just another star on the horizon. You will observe with horror the chaos of my thoughts, the clutter in my brain, the dust gathering in the parts of my heart I’ve long forgotten. There is childhood here, a pink barrette tucked far under the passenger seat, so far you may need to bite off your arm to reach it, and that’s for emergencies only.

At night, gas sits still and blood runs cold. Stan rocks me to sleep in his velour, driver seat pushed all the way back, blanket hiding my corpse from the stars. We wrap up in a cocoon and freeze, waiting for the morning sun to warm our bodies, to penetrate the fibres of woolen thread from which we will emerge. Time will stop to hold me static through fever dreams of spiders weaving cracks in glass windows. The world will turn, but Stan and I have shifted into park, refusing rotation of planets or wheels or gears. And then, I am reborn each day, shivering, sweating, clawing out of my blanket, stretching my neonatal legs to explore the abyss between go and stop.

This is my treasure chest, this is my photo box, this is my suitcase that I take from place to place. This is my world, which you may sit in for a while, until I drop you off at your destination and carry on. We always carry on, Stan and I. Everything I need for the rest of my journey is here, my snail shell, my mobile home, and onwards I will drive until it’s so dark I can’t see my reflection in the window, until it’s so loud I can’t hear the ever-tired exhale of the air conditioner pushing memories down my throat. The nights I spent on Sycamore Avenue, watching the house for signs of life years after it was stolen away. The early morning drives to the hospital, always running on empty, undrunk coffee forever staining my carpet. The feeling of watching the outside blur past me as I fearlessly press on, in control or not, a comet flying down an intergalactic causeway. Nothing matters except the road ahead, the steel below, the destiny I hold and turn and tease. There are no rules, except that gas is blood and blood is life. There are no rules, except that accidents can be happy and wrong ways may prove to be right.
